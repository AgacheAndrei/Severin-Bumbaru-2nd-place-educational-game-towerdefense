## Solution
A tower defense game with an educational theme, developed in C# using Unity. The game features 3D graphics, soundtrack, animations, gameplay mechanics, and is combined with elements of a board game.
<br>
The game is in the Romanian language, I mean the questions, the text from the end game and the loading screen, the game name etc.
## Story
The game is called "Lorzii Sesiunii" an tells the story of the computer since students from futere. Their campus is under heavy attack from Lorzii Sesiunii, mythical creatures from an alternative timeline. They want all students to have failed examens and torment the young lifes with unnecessary homeworks, projects, and powerpoints older than time. Your job is to help this students defend their home by strategic positioning them on the board to to repel attacks from waves of enemies and by answering correct at question about computer since to get coins to by more defense. 
## Gameplay -- info
<pre>
Enemies have different stats that range from week wizards to the strongest lord (3 types of enemies), they have only melee attacks.
The students range as well, from 2 types of range units with different fire rate, damage and price.
The board games gameplay feels like "Plant vs Zombies" drag and drop the unit where you want to defend. 
 ->But if a unit dies in a square of the board you cant put another one there. Choose wisely!
You have coins which you can spend on defend.
 ->The coins economy work like this:
    -If you kill a enemie you win some coins
    -You get coins over time
    -Answer correct you win coins, answer wrong you lose coins. Again choose wisely! 
When you want to answer a question, you press the button with a qustion mark --> the times freeze when you do this.
The game is only 2 levels with unique maps:
  ->if you beat both by surving all the waves of enemies ------> You win !!!!!! 🥇🥇🥇
  ->if the campus is damage to much by the enemies -------> You lose 🥲🥲🥲
When you beat all waves of enemies from the first lvl, you go to the next one!
You see a countdown before you can start the game.
